This example test that vc++ crt runtime 9.0 and 10.0 can be loaded into the same process, as there are side by side shared assemblies.

foo: a shared library built with vc9
bar: a executable built with vc10, and depends on foo

steps:
1. build foo
	* cd foo
	* premake4 vs2008
	* "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat"
	* msbuild foo.sln
2. build bar
	* cd bar
	* premake4 vs2010
	* "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat"
	* msbuild bar.sln
3. Copy foo.dll to bar/
